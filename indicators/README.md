MinMax Bands.\
This indicator helps me to see last bars support / resistance levels based on the higher highs/lower lows from the bars indicated on the Band_Period parameter. The green middlines are just fibonnacy leveles from the top/bottom lines, to see them you need to set to true the parameter ShowMiddleBands
